# Reaction to Universal Paperclips and AI Revolutions Part 1


I don’t consider myself a huge gamer by any means so I wasn’t expecting to get hooked to Universal Paperclips like I did over the weekend. I remember that a friend sent me the link to the game some time ago but after a couple of clicks I left it because I didn’t understand the point of the game. However, now that I spent more time playing with it I realized how addictive it can be.

One of the things that surprised me the most about this game is how after one point the game becomes very autonomous. During the first stages of the game you need to be very engaged with it making sure you don’t run out of wire, controlling the price of the paperclips and other small things but there comes a point during the game where the game can take control of itself. There wasn’t really much input from the player needed anymore. The game could run pretty much without the player’s input and it would still do its thing. The game became so independent that I just left it open on one tab and then continue to do my own thing on other tabs and there would be no problem. 

I found the game’s independence to be very much aligned with what the author of AI revolutions was arguing. He states that AI systems will reach human intelligence soon but once they reach it they won’t stop at that. These systems will just continue improving and improving until they surpass human intelligence. I feel like at the moment we’re at the stage of the game where you still have some control over the game and it actually needs your input. Right now programmers are the ones building the AI systems and tweaking them so they can improve. Nevertheless, this won’t be happening for too long. If what the author of the article was saying is true in a few years AI systems will have the ability to program themselves on their own without needing us. This scenario scares me but I think that’s in part because the article’s conclusion was very sensationalist. According to the author, intelligence is power so the super intelligent AI machines will have the most power in the world in the future. While I agree that intelligence is power, I don’t think that we would just let machines take control that easily. I’m pretty sure that there have to be some regulations put in place to prevent this from happening.
